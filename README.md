# My version of Namer app

An experimental app for word enthusiasts. This app randomly generates pairs of words for a quick mental workout. If you stumble upon a pair you like, hit the 'like' button, and it will be saved in your favorites.

No fancy promises hereâ€”just a simple way to test Flutter and play around with word combinations. It's a personal project, based on [this codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-codelab-first?hl=pt-br#0). Dive in, explore, and see if any word pairs strike a chord with you.
